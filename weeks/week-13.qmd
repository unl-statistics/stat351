# Week 13: Approaches to Big Data, SQL and SQLite



November 16-22, 2025



## 🥣 Prepare for class

Don't worry, the chapters from [Big Data Analytics](https://umatter.github.io/BigData/) by Ulrich Matter are much shorter than chapters I tend to write. I could probably learn something...
- [Approaches to Analyzing Big Data](https://umatter.github.io/BigData/approaches-to-analyzing-big-data.html)
- [Two Domains of Big Data Analytics](https://umatter.github.io/BigData/the-two-domains-of-big-data-analytics.html)
- [Data Collection and Data Storage](https://umatter.github.io/BigData/data-collection-and-data-storage.html) -- how to create and connect to databases in R.
- Practice Material -- [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) - a guided tutorial through the basics of SQL Queries


## 🌮 Tuesday

- We'll work through the Berkeley Statistics [Databases/SQL](https://computing.stat.berkeley.edu/tutorial-databases/) tutorial together in class.


## 🌩️ Thursday 🔨 

- Lab: [SQL Squid Game](https://datalemur.com/sql-game) -- participation grade. You must be in class to get credit.


##  🏋 Practice Your Skills
