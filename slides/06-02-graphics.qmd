Monthly cost (USD) of utilities (electricity, heating, cooling, water, garbage) in countries around the world. Lines are colored by continent, and show the change from 2020 to 2025. The point in 2025 shows the country\'s flag within the circle. For most countries, the cost has gone up, but this is particularly notable for european countries, who have seen the highest increase by far. A table of the original data is available at https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cost-of-utilities-around-the-world/#tablepress-6368_wrapper'}

![[Plot source](https://archive.ph/NRdq0)](images/graphics-financial-times-birth-rates.png){fig-alt='Line chart titled "Birth rates are falling more steeply among progressives than conservatives" with subtitle "Average number of children born to people at different points along the political spectrum, by era". Two subplots are shown: the US, and the developed world average. The US y axis has values between 2.8 and 1.8, while the developed world y axis has values between 2.2 and 1.6. In the US, the highest line corresponds to the 1970s and oscillates between 2.8 and just below 2.6, with little change across the political spectrum from left to right. In the 1990s, the average had dropped on the left to approximately 2.2, and goes up to 2.4 in the center and 2.7 on the right. In the 2010-2024 period, the average is 1.8 on the left and increases at every point along the spectrum to just over 2.6 on the right. Moving to the developed world, however, the 1990s line is at 2.1 on the left, dips down to just under 2 moving towards center-left, and then increases to just under 2.2 at the center, where it is relatively flat until the final point on the right side of the plot, where it is just above 2.2. In the 2010-2022 period, the line moves from 1.6 on the left to 1.8 at center-left, and increases steadily to 2.1 on the far right. Vertical arrows are shown on both plots to emphasize the change between the early data and the more recent data on the left side of the plot. The information is taken from the US General Social Survey and teh World Values Survey.'}

The y-axis goes from -1% to 7%, and the x-axis shows 2021H1, 2022 H1, 2023H1, ..., 2025H1 (presumably first and second halves of the year, with the first half labeled). In 2021, AI investment is highest, and in 2022, the total GDP growth was slightly negative, with AI investment nearly balancing out the rest of the economy. AI investment has been relatively small (.33%ish) through the other halves until 2025, when it registered as maybe .5%.'}
