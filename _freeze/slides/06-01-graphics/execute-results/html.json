The x-axis represents the increase or decrease in deaths per day, while the y-axis shows the average number of deaths per day. Curving lines in different colors represent the death trends from eight countries: USA (dark blue), France (light blue), Spain (yellow), Italy (red), UK (green), England and Wales (orange), China (purple), and Germany (light red). Notable dates and events such as lockdowns and other measures are marked along these lines, indicating changes in trends from March to April 2020. Annotations with specific dates are provided, such as \"3-Apr\", indicating notable shifts or inflection points in the trend lines.'}\n\n:::\n::: column\n\nHow do we describe this plot using the grammar?\n\n- X mapping: \n- Y mapping: \n- color mapping: \n- geoms: \n- stats:\n- position:\n- coordinate system:\n- transformations:\n\n:::\n::::\n\n## Alt Text and Accessibility\n\nThe original alt text for the plot on StackOverflow was \"The Rainbow Tornado\".\n\n- Does this help visually impaired users?\n\n- What would be a better description?\n\n- If you were visually impaired or hearing someone describe this chart, what would you want as a description?\n\n\n## Alt Text and Accessibility\n\nBest Practice:\n\n- Provide a 1-2 sentence alt-text AND a link to a longer description\n- Longer description should contain:\n  - the data source, \n  - a tabular representation of the data, and \n  - 1-2 paragraphs of description for the chart\n  \nThis is hard to do well (or integrate into the page).\n\n\n## Alt Text and Accessibility\n\nGood (but not best) Practice:\n\n- Provide a caption \n  - with the data source and \n  - link to a data table if it's easily available\n- Provide several sentences of alt text\n\n[Image Accessibility Checker](https://asuo-ai-labs.streamlit.app/Image_Accessibility) - AI image captions\n\n- Not perfect but decent\n- Manually check before using\n\n\n## Gestalt Principles of Grouping\n\n![](images/gestalt.jpg){fig-alt='The image illustrates the word \"GESTALT\" using various visual design concepts. Each letter is creatively manipulated to demonstrate principles of Gestalt psychology. The \"G\" uses partial shapes to suggest closure. The \"E\" consists of small squares to depict proximity. The \"S\" shows continuation with lines extending from its curves. The \"T\" and \"A\" demonstrate similarity with vertical stripes, while the \"A\" also features a tree-like shape within its form to illustrate figure and ground. The \"L\" and final \"T\" continue the use of vertical lines consistent with similarity.'}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Gestalt: Closure\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](06-01-graphics_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-alt='Kanizsa Triangle Illusion.
