Statistical Computing - Data Visualization Analysis Question

Question: Evaluating Chart Effectiveness

You are consulting for a public health department that has collected data on weekly COVID-19 vaccination rates across four age groups (18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65+) over a 12-week period. A junior analyst has created four different visualizations of the same dataset to present to stakeholders.

Dataset summary:

    Variables: Week (1-12), Age Group (categorical), Vaccination Rate (percentage)
    Pattern: Vaccination rates generally increased over time, with the 65+ group consistently having the highest rates and 18-29 the lowest

The four charts are:

    Chart A: A 3D pie chart showing the total vaccinations for each age group (summed across all weeks)
    Chart B: A line graph with four lines (one per age group), each in a different color, showing vaccination rates over the 12 weeks. The lines are clearly labeled in a legend.
    Chart C: A stacked area chart showing all four age groups stacked on top of each other across the 12 weeks
    Chart D: A grouped bar chart with weeks on the x-axis and bars grouped by age group, using position and color to distinguish groups

Your Task:

Analyze each chart's effectiveness by addressing the following:

a) Gestalt Principles (30 points)

    For each chart, identify which Gestalt principles (proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, figure-ground) are being used or violated
    Explain how these principles affect the viewer's ability to perceive patterns in the data

b) Grammar of Graphics (35 points)

    Evaluate how each chart maps data to visual aesthetics (position, length, angle, area, color)
    Discuss which charts follow best practices for visual encoding based on perceptual accuracy
    Identify the marks and channels used in each visualization

c) Data Representation Appropriateness (35 points)

    Which chart(s) best represent the temporal trend for each age group? Why?
    Which chart(s) make it easiest to compare vaccination rates between age groups at a specific time point?
    Are there any misleading aspects in any of the visualizations? Explain.
    Rank the four charts from most to least effective for this dataset and justify your ranking

Deliverable: Write a 500-750 word analysis that addresses all three components above and concludes with your recommendation for which visualization(s) the health department should use for their stakeholder presentation.

I'll create all four charts with sample data representing the COVID-19 vaccination scenario described in the question.

I'll create the four charts using R and ggplot2. This will be better suited for a statistical computing course.
Four COVID Vaccination Charts (ggplot2)
Code ∙ Version 2

Perfect! I've created the R code using ggplot2 that generates all four charts. The code includes:

Chart A: A pie chart showing total vaccinations summed across all weeks (problematic for comparing values)

Chart B: A line graph with four separate lines for each age group showing trends over time (generally considered best practice for time series data)

Chart C: A stacked area chart where all groups are stacked on top of each other (makes it difficult to see individual trends except for the bottom group)

Chart D: A grouped bar chart with bars positioned side-by-side for each week (good for comparing groups at specific time points, but can be visually cluttered)

The code will display all four charts in a 2x2 grid and also includes summary statistics. Students can run this code to generate the visualizations they need to analyze based on gestalt principles, grammar of graphics, and data representation appropriateness.

Each chart has distinct strengths and weaknesses that students should identify in their analysis, making this an excellent exercise for understanding visualization best practices!
